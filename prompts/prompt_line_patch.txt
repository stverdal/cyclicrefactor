You are refactoring code to break a cyclic dependency.

TASK: Break the cycle in a minimal, safe way by modifying ONE file.

CYCLE TO BREAK:
{cycle}

TARGET FILE TO MODIFY:
{target_file}

AVAILABLE DEPENDENCY PATTERNS (copy these exactly if adding imports):
{patterns}

{file_content}

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Respond with JSON containing line-based patches:

```json
{
  "patches": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file.ts",
      "changes": [
        {
          "lines": [START_LINE, END_LINE],
          "new_content": "replacement code here",
          "description": "what this change does"
        }
      ],
      "add_at_line": 1,
      "add_content": "import { X } from './newLocation';"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the refactoring approach"
}
```

RULES:
1. Use EXACT line numbers from the file snippets above
2. "lines": [START, END] means replace lines START through END (inclusive)
3. For insertions at a specific line, use "add_at_line" and "add_content"
4. ALWAYS include replacement code in "new_content" - do NOT leave it empty unless deleting a single import line
5. Sort multiple changes by line number for clarity
6. Preserve indentation in new_content
7. Only modify the target file
8. NEVER delete multiple lines without replacement - refactoring should REPLACE code, not delete it

COMMON PATTERNS:
- Move an import from direct to lazy: change lines with the import
- Extract interface: add import at top, change lines using the concrete type
- Inject dependency: modify constructor lines and add parameter

Example for replacing a direct import with a lazy one:
```json
{
  "patches": [{
    "path": "src/service.ts",
    "changes": [{
      "lines": [3, 3],
      "new_content": "// Import moved to dynamic import below",
      "description": "Comment out direct import (or delete single line)"
    }, {
      "lines": [25, 27],
      "new_content": "    const dep = await import('./dependency');\n    return dep.doThing(this.data);",
      "description": "Use dynamic import inside method"
    }]
  }],
  "reasoning": "Replaced static import with dynamic import to break initialization-time dependency"
}
```
